## R Markdown

`r var `
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

In 2018, a total of `{r number_of_shootings} ` occurred in the United States. A total of `{r number_lives_lost} ` were lost and the city most impacted (impact is measured as the sum of victims killed and victims injured) was `{r most_impacted_city} `. Further analysis was done broadly dividing the United States into two reigons; West and East of the Mississippi. The longitude used to create the reigons was -90 degrees. East of the Mississippi, the impact score totaled, `{r e_miss} `.vWest of the Mississippi scored, `{r w_miss} `.
